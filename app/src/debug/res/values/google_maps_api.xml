    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:

    EF:B7:E2:A0:36:55:BA:C1:46:14:D1:87:FF:73:6B:50:0D:BD:26:DF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    string in this file.
